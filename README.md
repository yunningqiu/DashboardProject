# DashboardProject
Dashboard (boxes, line graphs, a table, bar charts, a parallel category graph, a scatter plot) that reveals insights into movies that receive the highest ratings, revenue and awards to help movie investors make better decisions about what kind of movies to invest in.

Findings:
- The inclusive PG-13 view rating movies are the most popular ones. The six highest-grossing films of all time worldwide were all rated PG-13.
- Action-adventure movies have some of the most significant record-breaking ticket sales.
- Average ratings of movies are dropping over the years. Only the average Hidden Gem Score has increased in the recent ten years.
- 84.4% of movies receiving awards came from the year 2005-2020.
- Box Office and Rating are not necessarily positively correlated.
